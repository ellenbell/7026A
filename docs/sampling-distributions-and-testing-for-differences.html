<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Introduction<a href="sampling-distributions-and-testing-for-differences.html#introduction-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In the lecture last week we noted that one of the most important applications for statistical analyses is assessing whether differences exist between groups. In this and the next session, we are going to concentrate on a series of statistical analyses that allow us to determine whether there are differences between groups of data.
In developing an understanding of this form of statistical analysis, we have to be clear about two statistical concepts. These are the ideas of sampling and of probability.</p>
<div id="sampling" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Sampling<a href="sampling-distributions-and-testing-for-differences.html#sampling" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>What is the density of trees in the Amazon? We cannot measure this density precisely – we have estimate from samples. When presented with a large number of units that we could potentially measure, we can only usually measure a subset. In statistical language, this larger number is known as the population, which is the collection of units to which we want to generalise a set of findings. The subset taken from this population is termed a sample, and is defined as any portion of the population selected for study. This distinction is important, and is emphasised by using different symbols for the population and sample parameters (mean and standard deviation in particular). Importantly, if we calculate a statistic, then we are trying to estimate a population parameter.</p>
</div>
<div id="sampling-error" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Sampling error<a href="sampling-distributions-and-testing-for-differences.html#sampling-error" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The key goal in sampling is to select a portion of the population that displays all of the characteristics of the population. For example, if we take a sample of 100 British women, then we would expect statistics measured from these (height, weight etc.) to be representative of the population of British women. Critically, however, this sample would not have exactly the same mean, standard deviation etc. There is always some error in such estimates. Statistical analysis is designed to cope with such error.</p>
</div>
<div id="probability" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Probability<a href="sampling-distributions-and-testing-for-differences.html#probability" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In a sample, individuals (e.g. tall women, dense forest patches) that are more abundant will be encountered more frequently. The frequency distributions we looked at last week effectively represent the probability distribution of our observations. The height of a bar represents the probability of observing that class.</p>
<p>The normal distribution was introduced last week, as well as the standard deviation that measures the spread of this distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="variance" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Variance<a href="sampling-distributions-and-testing-for-differences.html#variance" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S^2 = \frac{\sum (X - \bar X)^2}{(n-1)}
\]</span>
Variance (S^2) is calculated as the sum of squared deviations from the mean. The standard deviation (SD) is then calculated as the square root of variance. It is easy to see how these both measure the spread in the data: the variance is the difference of each data point from the mean, squared (to remove the sign) and averaged. Square-rooting variance to give standard deviation allows this number to be presented in the correct units.</p>
</div>
<div id="standard-deviation" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Standard Deviation<a href="sampling-distributions-and-testing-for-differences.html#standard-deviation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\sigma= \sqrt{\frac{\sum (X - \bar X)^2}{(n-1)}}
\]</span></p>
<p>The standard deviation (usually abbreviated to SD or ) defines some important probabilities for the normal distribution, as shown in the graph on the left. For example, 95% of the data lie within the range given by ±1.96 standard deviations (an approximation of ± 2 standard deviations can therefore often be used as a rough guide to where 95% of the data lie).</p>
<p>We noted earlier that if we take a sample of a given size from a large population then we will not get the same estimate of the mean and SD each time. If we wanted to test a hypothesis about the mean then this could be a problem: how do we know whether variations between groups are due to chance variations or to real differences? Luckily we have a way of assessing this: if we estimate a mean from a sample of a population, then the mean and variance can be used to estimate how variable we would expect the sample mean to be, on average. This depends on:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The sample size: low sample sizes give more variable estimates of the population mean.</p></li>
<li><p>The variability in the population: the more variable the population, the
more variable the sample mean will be.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Standard error (SE) is the parameter which measures how well the sample mean is likely to reflect the population mean. It does this by dividing sample SD (the spread in the data) by the size of the sample (bigger samples are more likely to provide accurate estimates of the mean). Large SE’s can therefore result from widely spread data, small sample sizes, or both. A large sample from a narrow distribution will give a small SE, indicating that the sample mean is very likely to be close to the population mean.</p>
<p>If we have estimates of the mean and SD of a population, we can state the probability that the population mean is a given value. This is estimated by the t-distribution, which accounts for error in the estimates of the mean the population SD. A good example of how this works is the estimation of confidence intervals. As the graph shows, if from a sample size of 20 we estimate a mean ( x ) = 50, and a SE = 5, then the tdistribution can be used to calculate where we would expect the true population mean to be 95% of the time (which turns out to be between 40 and 60, i.e. the difference between the population and sample mean would be greater than 10 only 5% of the time).</p>
<p>This is a powerful statement: from the sample data we can calculate the probability with which we would expect the population mean to be greater or less than a given value. Two things are important here:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Sample size: this is used to calculate the SE and in selecting the appropriate value of t. For a sample size of n, the value of t has n-1 degrees of freedom (d.f.). All statistical tests use either d.f. or sample size to account for the likely accuracy of estimates.</p></li>
<li><p>Probability: in statistical analysis we say that an event is unlikely, and hence likely to be of significance, if there is less than a one in twenty probability of the result arising by chance (i.e. the probability of the event is 5% or less). Note that this means that if the probability of an event is &lt; 0.05, then this result can have arisen by chance one in twenty times.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A simple form of t-test is the one-sample t-test, which compares a sample of data to a pre-defined value. If the probability of the sample mean ( x ) being the same as the pre-defined value (  ) is &lt; 0.05, then we can state that there is a statistically significant difference between our sample mean and that value.</p>
<p>The most common use of the t-statistic is in comparing two samples to assess whether they are drawn from the same distribution, i.e. whether or not they are different. To do this, the 2-sample t-test first compares the means of the two samples; a small difference between these means makes it more likely that they are from the same distribution, however, this will also depend on the spread of the data. The t-test therefore also calculates a pooled estimate of the variance by taking an average of the squared deviations of the two samples. This pooled estimate of variance is then used to calculate the pooled standard error for the difference in the means. The t-statistic is then the difference between the means divided by the pooled SE.</p>
<p>Both the one- and two-sample t-tests have some very important
assumptions:
1) The data are drawn from a normal distribution.
2) In the two-sample analysis, it is assumed that the two samples are drawn from distributions with the same variances.</p>
<p>Violation of either of these assumptions COULD lead to invalid results.</p>
<p>But don’t panic - we will cover how to check these assumptions very straightforward.</p>
<p>Next Week: we will extend the ideas of analysing differences between
groups to the analysis and design of experiments</p>

<div id="some-key-terms-for-todays-practical" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="4.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Some key terms for todays practical<a href="sampling-distributions-and-testing-for-differences.html#some-key-terms-for-todays-practical" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Standard deviation: the standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the data. It is calculated from the variance, which is defined as the average squared deviation from the mean. Importantly, and in contrast with the standard error, the standard deviation is unaffected by the sample size.</p></li>
<li><p>Standard error: the standard error is a function of the sample size, and is defined as the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. Whilst the standard deviation measures the spread of the data, the standard error measures how the combination of the spread of the data and the number of measurements in our sample affect how well we are likely to have estimated the mean, i.e. it measures error in our estimate of the mean.</p></li>
<li><p>Degrees of freedom: in most parametric statistical tests we need to account for sample size, because larger samples will generally give better estimates of the mean and variance. Most statistical tests use “Degrees of Freedom (df) to represent sample size. The df for an estimate is the sample size minus the number of additional parameters (e.g. mean, SD) estimated for that calculation. As we estimate more parameters, the available degrees of freedom decrease. It can also be thought of as the number of observations (values) which are freely available to vary given the additional parameters estimated.</p></li>
<li><p>Statistical significance: When we do a statistical test we cannot state categorically that a hypothesis is true or false - rather, we have to state the probability that the hypothesis is true. For example, in the one-sample t-test that we look at below, we calculate a difference between our sample mean and another value. Then, based on the combination of the size of this difference, the variability within our data and the sample size, we calculate the probability that this difference is zero (i.e. that our mean is not different from the value we specified). When we do this we need some cut-off value to be able to say if our probability is big enough to regard as important - and Fisher decided that this would be a probability of P &lt; 0.05, that is a less than one-in-twenty probability that such a large difference would arise by chance alone.</p></li>

<p>Most data are collected as samples from larger collections or populations. The basis for all statistical analyses is attempting to infer population parameters (e.g. the population mean, variance, standard deviation etc.) from the sample data. This week’s practical is intended as an introduction to analysing data using simple tests on samples from populations.</p>
<p>You should all be reasonably familiar with SPSS after last week’s practical. The importance of exploratory analyses of data was also stressed last week: today we will apply some of these ideas in analysing data from a field study.</p>
<div id="the-data" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> The Data<a href="sampling-distributions-and-testing-for-differences.html#the-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>As many of you are new to Norfolk, we are going to analyse some data on the yields of sugar beet, which is something of a Norfolk specialty. Sugar beet is a root crop which is grown across East Anglia and into the Midlands. It is sown in March-April and then harvested in October. The roots are then used to make sugar. Being sown in April, the crop is rather vulnerable to attack by pests. In particular, plants are attacked by aphids, which transmit viruses to the crop. The main symptom of these viruses is a yellowing of the crop, and the viruses have the potential to reduce yields by up to 40%. However, sometimes the crop does not succumb to the virus and yields can be unaffected.
The data were taken from 56 fields in Norfolk &amp; Suffolk, half of which were determined to have viral infection, half of which did not. The data report the dry weight of sugar beet processed from each field at the same factory. The investigators wished to ask 2 questions of the data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Did yields in this year deviate from the long-term average yields for the region?</li>
<li>Did the presence of viruses affect the yield of sugar beet in this year?</li>
</ol>
<p>Before starting, answer the following questions:
&gt; * What constitutes the population(s) in this study?
&gt; * What hypotheses correspond to the two questions posed above (remember a good hypothesis should make a prediction)?
&gt; * What statistical tests would you use to test these hypotheses?</p>
<p>The data can be found in this class workspace LINK HERE. For each field, we have a measure of yield and whether or not it was infected by virus.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.6</span> Assumptions<a href="sampling-distributions-and-testing-for-differences.html#assumptions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>It is incredibly important to begin all statistical analyses with a visual inspection of your data, to assess the extent of any differences or associations and <strong>critically</strong>, to assess whether the assumptions of particular tests are met. In parametric tests of differences, data should be approximately normally distributed. If the data are skewed, you can explore whether the skew is influencing the outcome of the test, by comparing tests with and without datapoints driving the skew and/or comparing parametric and non-paramteric tests (we will cover these later in the course).</p>
<p>Parametric statistical tests make certain assumptions about the shape and distribution of the data. Specifically, in the case of the one-sample t-test, our data should ideally be normally distributed. You will sometimes see the “Kolmogorov-Smirnov” test used to explore the assumption of normality. The null hypothesis is that the data are drawn from a normal distribution, so P&lt;0.05 means that the data are statistically significantly different from a normal distribution. However, the real question is whether your data are sufficiently different from a normal distribution to make a parametric test result unreliable. There is no test for this, you have to explore your data and try different approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Did yields in this year deviate from the long-term average yields for the region?</strong></p>
<p>You should have answered above that in order to answer this question we require the “one-sample t-test”. This test allows us to look at whether the mean of a sample is statistically significantly different from a pre-specified value. In this case, we are using the test to ask whether the mean yield from our sample of fields is different from the long-term average yield. The basis for the t-test is the existence of sampling error. The data we have are from a sample, not from the whole population. In this example we have 56 fields (the sample) from all the fields of sugar beet grown in Britain (the population). We want to use the sample to infer something about the population. We know (hope!) that the sample will be representative of the population, but we also know that our estimates of population parameters (mean, variance) will not be exactly the same as those of the population. The t-test is derived from statistical sampling theory and allows us to specify, based on the sample size how likely it is (the statistical probability) that we have over- or under-estimated the population mean by a given amount.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
CI = \ \bar{X} ± (t * SEM)
\]</span></p>
<p>➢ Given that the value of the t-distribution for a sample size of 28 (i.e. each half of the data) is 2.052, calculate the 95% confidence intervals for the means of the two groups? (see page 12 for the formula).
➢ How many “degrees of freedom” are there?
You can check whether your answers are correct in the next section.
The long-term average yield for the region is 10.7 tonnes.
➢ Do the 95% confidence intervals for the two groups include 10.7?
• Choose Analyze&gt;&gt;Compare Means&gt;&gt;One sample t-test. Enter yield into the analysis and enter 10.7 as the test mean.
➢ What does the one-sample t-test indicate about whether the mean yields of the virus and non-virus affected fields differ from the long-term average?
17
Note that the output SPSS gives in the one-sample t-test includes the 95% Confidence Interval of the Difference. This is calculated from the difference between the sample mean and the hypothesised mean, and so is different from the 95% CIs that you calculated previously.
• To calculate actual 95% CIs, choose Analyze&gt;&gt;Descriptives&gt;&gt;Explore, and move the Yield variable into the Dependent list. Click OK.
➢ Compare the 95% CIs to the values that you calculated previously – did you get them right?</p>

<p><strong>Did the presence of viruses affect the yield of sugar beet in this year?</strong>
This time we need the two-sample t-test.
Two sample t-test: this test assesses whether the means of two samples are different from each other. It is therefore more commonly used than the one-sample test. The principle of the test is very similar to the one-sample test, but in the two-sample test we look at the standard error and confidence intervals for the difference between the means of the two samples. Specifically, we calculate a standard error for the difference between the two means, and then use this to generate a t-statistic. The assumptions of two-sample t-test are that the data for both samples are normally distributed and that the variances of the two groups are similar. In SPSS, this assumption of equal variance is tested as part of the t-test, using a test called Levene’s test for Equality of Variances.
• Before going on, return to the DATA menu and Split file, and choose to Analyse All Cases rather than to Split the file.
• From the Compare Means menu under Analyze, choose Independent Samples T-test. Move “Yield”, to the Test Variable box and “Virus” to the Grouping Variable box. You also need to define the two groups – click Define Groups and enter “V” for group 1 and “NV” for group 2. Click OK.
The output that you are given has 3 components:
1. Group Statistics gives the sample sizes, means etc. for the two groups.
2. The left-hand section of the second table gives the results of the “Levene’s test for Equality of Variances”
3. The right-hand section of the second box gives the results of the two-sample “t-test for Equality of Means”.
➢ What does the two-sample t-test assume about the variances of the groups you are comparing?
18
➢ The null hypothesis for Levene’s test predicts that the variances of the two groups are equal. Is this hypothesis rejected?
• If the Levene’s test is not significant (p&gt;0.05), you must use the t-test output in the line called “Equal Variances Assumed”. If the Levene’s test is significant (p&lt;0.05), then you must use the t-test output in the “Equal variances not assumed” line (this line includes a correction to the t-test to account for the unequal variance – the DF are lowered to make the test more conservative).
➢ Is there evidence that the means of the two groups are different?
➢ Write a summary of this analysis, including the statistics you have calculated.
There was no significant difference between the yields of the two groups, despite the fact that the virus-infected fields had significantly lower yields than the long-term average. Thus, comparison of the viral fields’ yields with the long-term average suggested that viral fields produced lower yields, but the difference between the viral and non-viral fields’ yields in this one year was not statistically significant.
➢ Why might viral fields have significantly lower yields than the long-term average but viral and non-viral fields have similar yields in this year?
➢ How would you confirm these differences in the future?</p>
