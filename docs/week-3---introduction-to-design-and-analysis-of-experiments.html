<p>There are two simple requirements that should guide the design of experiments: randomisation and replication. Replication is necessary because biological systems are variable, and so we need multiple measurements to distinguish meaningful effects from random variations. As the number of replicates or measurements increases, the standard error of the mean of the data becomes smaller.
The concept of randomisation is straightforward: if we set up an experiment to compare the behaviour of 2 species of lizard, for example, but place all our replicates for one species in one tank, and all our replicates for the other species in another tank, then we could not be certain whether the differences we observe are due to measurement error, or due to the differences between the tanks. Randomising an experiment can be done using tables of random numbers to allocate different treatments to your experimental units.</p>
<div id="completely-randomised-design" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Completely randomised design<a href="week-3---introduction-to-design-and-analysis-of-experiments.html#completely-randomised-design" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The layout on the left is an example of a randomised design: we have two treatments (A &amp; B), with five replicates of each treatment. There are 10 plots in all, and the experiment was randomised. This type of arrangement is called a completely randomised design.
There is a potential problem with the completely randomised design, however. This is because there is no restriction on the allocation of treatments to experimental units. All units from one treatment can, for example, end up on one side of the experimental area purely by chance. In the example on the left, for example, all the units on the left are treatment A. This would be bad if these units differed in levels of moisture, temperature, nutrients etc.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>One of the easiest ways to control for this kind of problem is through a blocked design. This is achieved by first grouping the experimental units into blocks. Each block contains as many experimental units as there are treatments; the allocation of treatments to units is then randomised within each block. This design considerably reduces the possibility of producing an uneven arrangement of treatments.
The blocked design is an improvement over the completely randomised design. It cannot, however, deal with trends across the experimental area.</p>
<p>Trends across experimental areas can sometimes be controlled by a form of design known as a Latin Square. The key to this design is that treatments are organised into rows and columns. In the example on the left, there are three treatments and each row and each column contains one of each treatment (for the nerds amongst you, it’s like a sudoku).
Blocked and Latin square designs may be mixed, but be warned, they can be difficult to analyse.
A multitude of different experimental designs exist: the examples above are the commonest forms of design, and illustrate how the experimenter can develop a design to cope with natural, uncontrollable variations in order to best study the biological factors of interest. Other designs include split plot designs that attempt to deal with practical restrictions. For example, if plot size were 3m x 3m but the equipment required to apply the treatment covers a minimum area of 12m x 3m, then we could not randomise the treatment. Instead we split the 12m x 12m plot into 4 plots. In the example on the left, the grey and white show one factor, which is applied in a split plot fashion; the other (1, 2, 3, 4) is completely randomised.
When we take measurements from the same experimental unit (e.g. if we measure the effects of a treatment on the growth of an animal at several points through its life) we repeatedly take observations from the same unit. This type of design is called a repeated measures design. Analysis of this type of design accounts for both the treatment effect and the temporal sequence of measurements.
Last week we saw that the difference between two groups can be analysed using a t-test. The t-test can only be used to compare two groups. When our experiment contains 3 or more groups, we use a technique called Analysis of Variance or ANOVA for short.
The null hypothesis in an ANOVA is that samples from different treatments are drawn from different populations with the same means. If our analysis indicates that the probability that this hypothesis is true is less than 1 in 20 (p&lt;0.05), then at least one of the treatments has a different mean from the others.
ANOVA uses the data to calculate two estimates of the variance in the populations.
1. Error variance is an estimate of the mean variance found within each treatment It is calculated by summing the variances found within each of the samples (remember this is the ‘Sum of Squares’ - the sum of the squared deviations from the mean) and then averaging them (the Mean Squares - Sum of Squares/DF).</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Between-treatment variance is an estimate of the variance between the sample means. It is calculated by summing the differences between each treatment mean and the overall mean of all of the treatments together, and then averaging them.
If the means of the treatments vary but the variance within the treatments is similar to the variance between treatments, then it will be unlikely that significant differences between the treatments can be identified. By contrast, if the within-treatment variance is small relative to the between-treatment variance, then it is more likely that statistically significant differences between the means will exist.
We therefore need to be able to compare within- and between- treatment variances to determine whether the null hypothesis is likely to be true. This is done by calculating the ratio of these two variances, called the F-ratio.
• if the within and between treatment variance estimates are the same, then F = 1.
• if the between-treatment estimate of variance is greater than the within-treatment estimate of variance, then the value of F will be much bigger than 1. Clear differences between treatments therefore result in larger values of F.
For a given value of F, and for a given number of treatments and replicates, we can then calculate the probability that the null hypothesis (no difference between treatment means) is true: again this critical level is 1 in 20, or p&lt;0.05.
There is a standard way of presenting the results of an ANOVA in a table, like this:
SOURCE DF
BETWEEN 2 WITHIN 21 TOTAL 23
SUM OF
SQUARES SQUARE
634.08
156.88 7.47 790.95
0.000
There are four key things to look for:</li>
<li>Mean Square: this is the average variance, and it is calculated
BETWEEN and WITHIN treatments, by dividing the respective
Sums of Squares by DF.</li>
<li>F-Ratio: this is Between MS divided by Within MS. Remember
large values (&gt;&gt;1) imply differences.</li>
<li>Degrees of Freedom: if you have T treatments and r replicates (in
the above table, T = 3 and r = 8), then Between-treatment DF is calculated as T-1. Within-treatment DF = T(r-1) and Total DF = Tr-1.</li>
<li>Probability: this is the probability of obtaining that value of F for those samples sizes.
We are not limited to analysing the effects of just one factor: in an agricultural experiment we could, for example, vary the levels of two different nutrients. For example:</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider an experiment in which we varied Nitrogen (High and Low) and Phosphorus (High and Low). There are 4 Combinations of nutrient levels. This means that we are interested in three comparisons:
1. HN vs. LN
2. HP vs. LP
3.HPand HNvs.LPandLN
1. and 2. are termed Main Effects: these are the basic factor levels that we have varied. 3. is termed an Interaction term.
We may find that increasing the level of either N or P on their own increases yields.
However, these effects may not be independent. When combined, high levels of both N &amp; P may increase yields by more than the sum of their individual effects (synergistic) or by less than the sum of their individual effects (antagonistic).
Interaction effects are tested in exactly the same way as main effects, using an F-ratio. The ANOVA table is slightly modified:
SOURCE
NITROGEN
PHOSPHORUS
NITROGEN *
PHOSPHORUS
ERROR
DF SUM OF SQUARES
1 376.04 1 3.37
1 84.37
20 69.16
MEAN F-RATIO PROB SQUARE
376.04 108.74 0.000 3.37 0.97 0.335
84.37 24.39 0.000
3.45
In this example there is a significant effect of nitrogen on yields, but not phosphorus. In addition, the significant interaction term indicates that the response of yields to nitrogen varies depending on the level of phosphorus.
ANOVA can tell us when there are significant differences between the means of treatments, but it cannot identify which treatment differs from which other treatments. Post hoc tests are used to find where differences lie. Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference is a widely used post-hoc test. Post-hoc tests are briefly explored in the practical.
We will go on to look at how to test for relationships among different variables, as opposed to differences between them.</p>

<p>The aim of this week’s practical is to introduce the analysis of experimental data using one- and two- way analyses of variance (ANOVA). These analyses are used for testing for differences between treatments in fully randomised experiments. Note that other forms of experimental design, such as the randomised block and the Latin square require modified forms of ANOVA, although the basic ideas are the same.
SPSS is a bit picky about how you enter the levels of factors for an ANOVA: last week were able to split the viral and non-viral fields by using a string column containing ‘V’ and ‘NV’. We cannot do this when we enter factors for an ANOVA. Instead we have to enter a list of successive integers: e.g. if we had 4 treatments A, B, C, &amp; D, we have to code these as 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4 respectively.</p>

<div id="the-data-1" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="5.2.2">

<p>Sorry to continue the rather agricultural theme of these practicals (Rob Freckleton’s fault, not mine), but some of the best and most appropriate data Rob had were from agricultural experiments. As an historical aside, this is also rather appropriate, as ANOVA and many other statistical analyses were designed by R. A. Fisher whilst working on long-term crop yield studies at Rothamsted. Today we are going to look at data from two experiments:
Experiment 1. Comparison of the yields of four different carrot varieties. In this experiment, six plots of each of the four varieties were grown, with the plots allocated to varieties in a completely random manner.
Experiment 2. Effects of light and gender on feeding behaviour in chickens. This rather bizarre experiment aimed to determine the effect of light colour and sex on the rate at which chickens feed, Feeding rates were measured as the number of pecks made in a 15 minute period. There were 24 cages in total, half of which were illuminated with white light, and half with red light. Half of the 12 white- light cages were allocated a male chicken, and half a female chicken, and the same for the 12 red-light cages. The treatments were allocated to cages in a completely randomised manner.</p>
</div>
<div id="one-way-anova" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="5.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.3</span> One-way ANOVA<a href="week-3---introduction-to-design-and-analysis-of-experiments.html#one-way-anova" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The data for both experiments are on page 28. The data for the carrot experiment are in the first table. In order to analyse these data using an ANOVA, we need to enter them into SPSS in the correct format: SPSS requires one column containing the dependent variable (carrot yields) and a second column containing the factor levels (varieties).
• Create two columns of data, one called YIELD, and the other called VARIETY. Enter the yields and corresponding variety, coding A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.
• Visually inspect the data to assess their distributions, whether they are (approximately) normal and whether there appear to be differences between the means and variances of the varieties (remember to split the file…and to un-split the file again before carrying on).
24
• Write down the means and standard errors for each of the yields of the four varieties. ➢ Do the treatment yields appear to differ and, if so, how do they differ?
The null hypothesis for the one-way ANOVA is that all groups are drawn from populations with the same mean. Therefore, if the probability of the null hypothesis being true is small, then there is evidence that the samples are taken from populations with different means.
➢ Before running the ANOVA, write down what you understand by the terms: Sums of Squares, Mean square and F-ratio.</p>
<p>ANOVA: remember that the analysis of variance works by asking whether the variance between the experimental groups is as large, or larger, than the variance within the experimental groups. The F- ratio then compares these two quantities, by dividing the variance between groups by the variance within groups. The null hypothesis is that these are the same, i.e. F = 1.
Assumptions: the assumptions of ANOVA are that the data for all treatments are normally distributed and that the variances of all treatments are equal.
• Choose ANALYZE&gt;&gt;COMPARE MEANS&gt;&gt;ONE-WAY ANOVA. Enter Yield into the Dependent list, and Variety into the Factor list. To test the assumption of equal variances, choose OPTIONS and select the Homogeneity of Variances (i.e. whether the variances are the same) test. Click OK.
• First check whether the assumption of equal variances amongst treatments is met, by checking the Tests for Homogeneity of Variances table.
➢ The null hypothesis for this test is that the variances of all the groups are the same. Does the probability indicate that this null hypothesis is likely to be true?
• If the variances of the treatments do not differ significantly, move on to the main ANOVA output.
➢ Can you explain how the value of the F-ratio in this table is calculated?
➢ What would an F-ratio close to 1 indicate?
➢ What does the probability attached to the F-ratio indicate about the mean yields of the varieties?
25
The analysis indicates that there are some differences between the varieties of the groups but we do not know where these differences lie. To find this out, we are going to use a post hoc test. These operate like a series of pair-wise comparisons of the treatments, and will identify where significant differences exist between the means of the different varieties.
• Choose ANALYZE&gt;&gt;COMPARE MEANS&gt;&gt;ONE-WAY ANOVA. This time click on Post Hoc, and choose Tukey (not Tukey’s-b). This is the most commonly reported post-hoc test for ANOVA.
• The Multiple Comparisons table indicates the pairs of treatment means that are significantly different from one another. The Homogenous Subsets table gives the same information but in a different format.
➢ Which varieties are significantly different from one another?
➢ Write a short summary of the results.
➢ How could you represent these results in a graph?</p>

<p>The analysis of Experiment 2 requires a two-way ANOVA since there are two factors in the experiment: light colour and sex. Note that you can have more than two factors in a multi-way ANOVA (although the more you have, the harder it can be to interpret the results).
• Create 3 columns: COLOUR, SEX and RATE. Enter the data using the coding 1 = white light, 2 = red light, and 3 = male, 4 = female.
• Check whether the data for each group are (approximately) normally distributed.
• Draw an Error Bar plot to visualise the differences. Under Graphs, select Error Bar and Simple. Enter rate as the Variable and colour as the Category Axis. Then repeat this process but replace colour with sex.
➢ Do chicken peck rates vary between the sexes and the colours?
26
• To run the 2-way ANOVA, choose ANALYZE&gt;&gt;GENERAL LINEAR MODEL&gt;&gt;UNIVARIATE. Enter rate as the Dependent Variable, and sex and colour as the Fixed Factors (and select Options&gt;Homogeneity tests, to check the assumption of equal variances). Click OK.
➢ What does the output of the Homogeneity test tell you?
The output table looks more complex than the previous ANOVA output. However, we are mainly interested in the central 5 lines of this output - the other lines (Corrected Model, Intercept and Corrected Total) are to do with aggregating main and interaction effects, and are not of interest at this point.
➢ Fill in the blanks in this table. Source of Variation

Note that the Error can also be called Residual or Within sum of squares.
➢ Do either or both of the main effects significantly influence the pecking rate?
➢ Is there evidence of a significant interaction between Colour and Sex?
➢ What does this interaction tell you about chicken pecking rates?
➢ What would a non-significant interaction indicate?
• To visualise the interaction term, draw another Error Bar plot but this time select Clustered. Enter rate as the Variable, colour as the Category Axis and Define Clusters by sex.
➢ Write down a short summary of the analysis.</p>
